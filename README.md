# LaTeX Template

LaTeX template for any project.

## Instruction

1. Copy everything inside this template directory into your project directory.
1. Rename `template.tex` to `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.tex`.
1. Change project name in makefile `PROJNAME=YOUR_PROJECT_NAME`.
1. Run make.

## Requirement/Tips

### For Windows Users

- Install make for windows or even better, install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

## For VSCode Users

- There are VSCode tasks included in this repository. Make sure the LaTeX programs are included in the Path.
- Install LaTeX Workshop Extensions for autocomplete feature
- Due to personal preferences, I use latexmk instead of the extensions build recipe, so I disabled the auto-build feature.

### Notes

Tested with TeX Live 2021.
